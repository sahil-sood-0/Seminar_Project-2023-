# Seminar_Project-2023-
This is the Project we worked on during our seminar (fall session), where we worked on the Business Capstone Project, where the data was managed from a General Store situated in London.
Cohort analysis allows a company to see patterns clearly across the life cycle of a customer rather than slicing across all customers blindly without accounting for the natural cycle that a customer undergoes. By seeing these patterns of time, a company can adapt and tailor its service to those specific cohorts.
